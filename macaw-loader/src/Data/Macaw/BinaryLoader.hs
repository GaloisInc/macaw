-- | A class for architecture and binary container independent binary loading
--
-- An instance is required for every arch/format pair, but the interface is more
-- accessible to callers than some alternatives.
--
-- n.b. The (MM.MemWidth (MR.ArchAddrWidth arch)) constraint enables
-- the LoadedBinary output type to functions by simply expressing
-- (BinaryLoader arch binFmt) as a constraint on those functions, but
-- many of the usage sites will still need to express a constraint
-- like:
--
-- > (BinaryAddrWidth binFmt ~ MC.ArchAddrWidth arch) =>
--
-- It would be nice to add that constraint directly to the class here,
-- but the macaw-loader family should only depend on macaw-base and
-- whatever loader (e.g. elf), and adding the above constraint
-- requires definitions from the macaw architecture specific modules
-- (e.g. macaw-ppc), creating a dependency cycle (because macaw-ppc
-- should be able to use macaw-loader-ppc). Ergo this constraint must
-- be expressed at the usage sites instead.

  --
  -- This function is allowed (and encouraged) to find all possible
  -- entry points based on the metadata available in a binary.  Note
  -- that there is no guarantee of uniqueness in the results; in
  -- particular, an ELF file usually specifies an entryPoint address
  -- that is also an address in the symbol table, both of which are in
  -- the data returned by this function.

  --
  -- This can fail if the address:
  --
  -- * Does not correspond to a global or function
  -- * Does not have an associated symbol
  --
  -- Symbols are 'BS.ByteString's because there is no encoding prescribed for them
  --
  -- This function is provided as 1) a container format independent method for
  -- accessing symbol information, and 2) to handle complex translations that
  -- may be required to interpret symbol addresses on a per-architecture basis.
