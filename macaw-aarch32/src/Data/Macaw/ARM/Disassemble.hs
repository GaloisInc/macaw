General notes regarding the disassembly process for ARM.

ARM disassembly is complicated by the different instruction set states
that an ARM processor supports.  There are technically 4 different
instruction sets: ARM32, Thumb32, Thumb32EE, and Jazelle.  At the
present time, only the first two are supported by macaw-arm
(identified hereafter as A32 and T32).

When macaw base's Discovery is attempting to discover code to
construct the CFG and attach it to the semantics, it is unaware of
these different instruction set modes.

Normally a switch from one instruction set to another is accomplished
via a cross-mode branch (e.g. BRX), which will be identified by normal
processes as the end of a particular code block.  However, there are
many instructions which can target R15 (i.e. the PC) and therefore
potentially cause an ISETSTATE (Instruction Set State) switch.

To handle the above:

  * At the beginning of disassembly, a current mode must be known.
    Although macaw-base could be extended to allow the
    architecture-specific module to persist information across calls
    to disassembly, this value can also be extracted from the initial
    AbsProcessorState.

  * The disassembly should only try to disassemble for the current
    mode, and should exit (with the FetchAndExecute status) whenever
    the ISETSTATE changes. (This may require enhancing the
    post-semantics disassembleBlock functionality below to detect
    ISETSTATE differences).

  * The macaw-base functionality will then create a block up to this
    point, and the FetchAndExecute status will cause the instructions
    at this point to be declared as another frontier for subsequent
    block discovery.  The AbsProcessorState associated with this
    frontier will inform the subsequent call to disassemblyFn which
    ISETSTATE is applicable for that disassembly.

Notes:

  * At the present time (Aug 15 2018), the code below *improperly*
    attempts to use the low bit of the PC register to determine which
    operational mode is newly in effect.  This is wrong because the
    semantics for an instruction will effect the ISETSTATE change and
    then clear the bits when writing to the PC.  This should be
    re-worked to use the above described functionality instead.
