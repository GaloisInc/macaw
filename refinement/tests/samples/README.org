The contents of this directory provide several "golden" tests: a
binary file along with a file containing the results of the base macaw
discovery and also a file containing the results of the refined
discovery are present for several architectural variants.

The test utility will perform both base discovery and discovery
refinement and compare the results obtained to the expected results
recorded in the files here to determine if both discovery and
refinement are operating as expected.

* Skipped Tests

- ~address-of-label1.ppc.gcc.pie.*.exe~

  These are not tested because this test cannot be made PIE on PowerPC.  The
  address-of-label uses add relocations that aren't supported in static PIE
  mode.
