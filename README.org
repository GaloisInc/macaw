This library provides a uniform interface to load a binary (e.g. in
ELF format) and get [[https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw][macaw]] Memory and a list of entry points.

This also helps extracting auxiliary information (e.g. the PPC
TOC/Table-Of-Contents).  It tries to encapsulate a lot of the extra
logic around entry point identification (like wanting to use the TOC
on PowerPC).

The 'binaryRepr' used here is not just a width in order to allow
future support of a Mach-O and/or PE repr as well as the ELF format.

* Hierarchy

The modules in this repository should require macaw-base, and possibly
semmc, but they should not require any higher-level macaw operations.
These modules should be useable independently of or by the
higher-level macaw modules.
