This test suite tests that symbolic execution of AArch32 programs works. It is also a convenient place to test the semantics.  The test harness looks for binaries in the ~pass~ and ~fail~ subdirectories.  In both cases, it enumerates the functions whose names are prefixed by ~test_~, each of which are symbolically executed with fully symbolic initial states.  It treats the return value of each test function as an assertion that it will attempt to prove (i.e., it checks the satisfiability of the assertion).  Test cases in ~pass~ are expected to return a value that is always true, while the test cases in ~fail~ are expected to not always be true (but note that the precise models are not inspected).

It currently tests both optimized an unoptimized binaries. It is intended that this set will expand and that a wide variety of compilers will be tested.
