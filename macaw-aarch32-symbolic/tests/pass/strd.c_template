// In Ubuntu 20.04, compiling this C code will result in the assembly code in

// testing the issue in https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw/issues/301. As such,
// I've checked in the assembly code to ensure that we can continue testing code
// involving strd, but I've also checked in the original C code as a reference.
