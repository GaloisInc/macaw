-- | This module defines common test harness code that can be used in each of the
-- architecture-specific backends.
--
-- The model is:
--
-- 1. Load an ELF file (returning the ELF) and run code discovery on it plus
--    any shared libraries that it depends on (returning a 'BinariesInfo').
--
-- 2. Provide the harness a list of discovered functions to simulate and try to
--    prove the result of (there is a helper for selecting tests whose name
--    begins with @test_@).

Note [Shared libraries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module provides functional (but greatly simplified) means to simulate
binaries that dynamically link shared libraries. We make several assumptions
about how shared libraries work that are not true in general, but close enough
for our purposes. This Note describes all of these assumptions.

=====
== Address offsets for shared libraries
=====

When loading a binary with shared library dependencies, we must ensure that the
absolute addresses for each binary do not clash with each other. We accomplish
this by using the following conventions for address offsets when loading
binaries:

* Addresses in the main binary are loaded as-is.
* For shared libraries lib_1, lib_2, ..., lib_n, the addresses in lib_i are
  offset by `0x10000000 * i`. (See `indexToLoadOptions`.)

When resolving address in macaw, we must also go in the opposite direction.
That is, we must be able to take an address with an already-applied offset and
determine which binary it originally came from. To do so:

* The `addressToIndex` function masks off the low bits in the address to
  determine the index of the binary. For instance, given the address
  0x20001000, its high bits are 2, indicating that the address comes from the
  second shared library. If the index is 0, then the address comes from the
  main binary.
* A `BinariesInfo` value contains the main binary and a vector containing each
  shared library at an index suitable for use with the indexing conventions
  established above. To retrieve the appropriate Memory for an address offset,
  use the value computed by `addressToIndex` as an index into `binaryInfoAt`.

Be aware of the caveats to this approach to offsets:

* This load offset calculation is safe so long as all binaries are
  under 256MB.  It seems likely that something else in macaw would
  fail before binaries reach that size.

* On 32-bit architectures, index values of 16 or higher will cause
  the offset to reach inaccessible values.  Macaw throws an exception in
  this case.  If this occurs in practice we will need to reduce the offset
  multiplier to something smaller (the trade-off is that the maximum
  allowable library size will also decrease).

* This approach requires some care regarding PLT stubs, as they add a layer of
  indirection between PLT function addresses, which reside in one binary, and
  the addresses that they ultimately jump to, which reside in a different
  binary. (See Note [PLT stub names] in Data.Macaw.Memory.ElfLoader.PLTStubs.)
  For this reason, PLT stubs are handled in a special case in `lookupFunction`
  that bypasses the indexing mechanisms described above.

* The commentary above describes one particular load strategy for shared
  objects. In the future, we will want to be able to configure the load
  strategy so that we can model things like address-space layout randomization
  (ASLR). If we do this, we will need to update the code for resolving addresses
  accordingly.

=====
== Loading shared libraries
=====

The `runDiscovery` function is responsible for actually loading each shared
library, making sure to respect the indexing conventions established above.
See Note [Dynamic lookup scope] in Data.Macaw.Memory.ElfLoader.DynamicDependencies
for a description of the assumptions that are made when loading shared
libraries. One additional assumption that we make is that all of a binary's
shared libraries live in the same directory as the binary itself, which is fine
for testing purposes.

=====
== Simulating PLT stubs in shared libraries
=====

As described above, each shared library's absolute addresses are loaded at
different offsets so that they will not clash with each other during
simulation. But how does the simulator know when one binary calls into a
different shared library? This is where PLT stubs come into play.

When the simulator encounters a PLT stub in a binary, that indicates that it
must now simulate a function of the same name in a shared library.  The
`dynamicFunMap` field in a `BinariesInfo` value maps the names of global,
dynamic functions (which are the only functions that PLT stubs could reasonably
jump to) to their absolute addresses.  The simulator consults the
`dynamicFunMap` to determine which shared library to jump to and then proceeds
like normal. See `lookupFunction` for how this is implemented.

Constructing the `dynamicFunMap` is somewhat subtle, as it is possible for
multiple shared libraries to define global functions with the same name. If
this happens, then macaw uses the following approach to determine which
function symbol gets priority, as implemented in the `addSymbolWithPriority`
function:

1. Global symbols are favored over weak symbols. See the "Weak symbols" section
   for more details.

2. Otherwise, favor symbols that appear in earlier binaries over later ones,
   as described in the the lookup scheme in Note [Dynamic lookup scope] in
   Data.Macaw.Memory.ElfLoader.DynamicDependencies.

=====
== Weak symbols
=====

Weak symbols are like global symbols, except that a weak symbol is allowed to
be overridden by a global symbol of the same name. Libraries like libc use weak
symbols all over the place. For instance, libc might have a weak symbol named
setuid and a global symbol named __setuid at the same function address. A PLT
stub that jumps to setuid() will likely use the former symbol name, however, so
it's important for macaw to be aware of them.

Much of the time, if a weak symbol exists in a binary, then there is no
corresponding global symbol of the same name. This is because the linker
usually removes weak symbols of this sort, so by the time macaw-symbolic
simulates the binary, any potential name conflicts between weak and global
symbols have already been resolved. Still, it's difficult to state with
confidence that such a scenario could never happen. Just in case it does, we
manually resolve such naming conflicts (in `addSymbolWithPriority`) by favoring
global symbols over weak symbols in case of a name conflict.

=====
== Dynamic relocations
=====

For now, we do wish to handle the intricacies of dynamic relocations. We need
to do /something/ about relocations, however, since macaw-symbolic will need to
load them into the global address space. Our approach (as implemented in
`populateRelocation`) is to populate relocation regions of the address space
with symbolic bytes. As long as the test cases do not make critical use of
relocations, this is a reasonable choice.
