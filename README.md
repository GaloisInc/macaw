This is the main repository for the Macaw binary analysis framework.
This framework is implemented to offer extensible support for
architectures.

# Overview

The main algorithm implemented so far is a code discovery procedure
which will discover reachable code in the binary given one or more
entry points such as `_start` or the current symbols.

The Macaw libraries are:

* macaw-base -- The core architecture-independent operations and
  algorithms.
* macaw-symbolic -- Library that provides symbolic simulation of Macaw
  programs via Crucible.
* macaw-x86 -- Provides definitions enabling Macaw to be used on
  X86_64 programs.
* macaw-x86-symbolic -- Adds Macaw-symbolic extensions needed to
  support x86.
* macaw-semmc -- Contains the architecture-independent components of
  the translation from semmc semantics into macaw IR.  This provides
  the shared infrastructure for all of our backends; this will include
  the Template Haskell function to create a state transformer function
  from learned semantics files provided by the _semmc_ library.
* macaw-arm -- Enables macaw for ARM (32-bit) binaries by reading the
  semantics files generated by _semmc_ and using Template Haskell to
  generate a function that transforms machine states according to the
  learned semantics.
* macaw-arm-symbolic -- Enables macaw/crucible symbolic simulation for
  ARM (32-bit) architectures.
* macaw-ppc -- Enables macaw for PPC (32-bit and 64-bit) binaries by reading the
  semantics files generated by _semmc_ and using Template Haskell to
  generate a function that transforms machine states according to the
  learned semantics..
* macaw-ppc-symbolic -- Enables macaw/crucible symbolic simulation for
  PPC architectures
* macaw-refinement -- Enables additional architecture-independent
  refinement of code discovery.  This can enable discovery of more
  functionality than is revealed by the analysis in macaw-base.

The libraries that make up Macaw are released under the BSD license.

These Macaw core libraries depend on a number of different supporting libraries, including:

* elf-edit -- loading and parsing of ELF binary files
* galois-dwarf -- retrieval of Dwarf debugging information from binary files
* flexdis86 -- disassembly and semantics for x86 architectures
* dismantle -- disassembly for ARM and PPC architectures
* semmc -- semantics definitions for ARM and PPC architectures
* crucible -- Symbolic execution and analysis
* what4 -- Symbolic representation for the crucible backend
* parameterized-utils -- utilities for working with parameterized types

# Building

## Preparation

Dependencies for building Macaw that are not obtained from Hackage are
supported via Git submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init


## Building with Cabal

The Macaw libraries can be individually built with Cabal v1, but as a
group and more easily with Cabal v2:

    $ ln -s cabal.project.dist cabal.project
    $ cabal v2-configure
    $ cabal v2-build all

To build a single library, either specify that library name instaed of
`all`, or change to that library's subdirectory before building:

    $ cabal v2-build macaw-refinement

 or

    $ cd refinement
    $ cabal v2-build

## Building with Stack

To build with Stack, first create a top-level `stack.yaml` file by
symlinking to one of the provided `stack-ghc-<version>.yaml`
files. E.g.

    $ ln -s stack-ghc-8.6.3.yaml stack.yaml
    $ stack build

# Status

This codebase is a work in progress.  Support for PowerPC support
(both 32 and 64 bit) and X86_64 is reasonably robust.  Support for ARM
is ongoing.

# License

This code is made available under the BSD3 license and without any support.
